# Website-Blocker

## Version 0.2.0 Update
Time limit feature is finished, now you can set the time limit for each website.

I created two mode in this version, one is default mode and another is strict mode. Default mode is like the description above and strict mode restrict all the website in your block list. Strict mode has some bugs that I'm trying to figure them out.

## Version 0.1.0 Update
This program is a chrome extension to block the website, version 0.1 can only block the website access.

I'm developing the time limit feature for website blocker, hopefully, it will not take too long.
